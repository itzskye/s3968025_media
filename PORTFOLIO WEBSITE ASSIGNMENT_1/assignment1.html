<p> Above is my final cut for the assignment. Throughout the process of editing and re-editing this I believe I have refined the story I am attempting to portray and have made improvements since my original edit to achieve greater context. </p>
<p> Shown below is my process, and test edits, created in the process of making this final video.</p>
    <br>
    <p>An excerpt from a progress entry I had made;<br><br> "For this weeks task I have attempted to merge the audio of 1 video with the visuals of another and try to form new context using this found footage. Below I have a screenshot of my work and the completed short clip I have created." </p>
<p> A Screenshot from my first week of progress: </p>

    <p>I chose to use the footage of the VR television program and the audio of the space program to juxtapose the technology based universe that is being created. I chose to use the presenter as the ancient alien figure gifting the new universe to the other characters. I also used the hands many times a a vessel for the transferring of information in the video and using the imagery to match up a few match cuts.  </p>

    <p>Below is my storyboarding process for the video, despite the final cut not matching the planned scenes the process aided in rethinking the flow of the video</p>
