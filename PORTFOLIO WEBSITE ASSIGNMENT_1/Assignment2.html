<p> <br> Throughout this assignment as a class we were asked to come up with ideas for  nine unified and responsive graphic icons in a flat design style. 

    ​<br>​<br>
    
    I have applied design thinking with spacing, style and colour choices to further the world building of the story I am attempting to portray and have chosen and edited down 9 sounds  I have sourced from an open source library to further convey the story. 
    
    ​​<br>​<br>
    
    The setting: The Platform capitalists have essentially enslaved humanity as they have devised the most cost efficient and successful methods for controlling the masses. 
    
    ​​<br>​<br>
    
    The communist neo-luddite group have banded together and grown over many years. They wish to return to the land and leave technology behind, to reconnect with the earth and to their fellow man .
    
    ​<br>​<br>
    
    They have formed their own community hidden in the outback. 
    
    ​<br>​<br>
    
    Growing crops and avoiding detection for their very existence is a threat to the profit margins of the privatised state. 
     
    ​<br>​<br>
    These are their signals for ideology, danger, community  and resources.

    Will you stand up from your gaming chair, detach your food tube and  touch grass with your new found comrades?  </p>
