    Trip to Sydney <br><br>
    In June I went to sydney for a contemporary arts festival and the ensuing after party. When I travelled I stayed in a space themed pod hotel because it was the cheapest option available at the time. I arrived their 1 day early and spent my time exploring the city and going to recommended cafe's, bars and shops. the day after I attended Soft Centre and as it came to a close headed in an uber to the address I had been messaged from the organisers for the afterparty. I arrived in a daze and an old middle eastern man approached and whispered to me "this way" he lead me inside a regular seeming office building to the reception where someone was checking tickets. I  walked upstairs to the designated floor. still with office equipment lying around. still in okay condition but with new lighting fitted and great speakers. I'm aiming to recrete these 3 spaces within my game. In a way that weekend almost felt like a game with the grungy futuristic aesthetic pervasive in all aspects of my journey.</p>

    <p>Using a blender plugin called scene city which had a tie in unity plugin I was able to easily customise a city area and export it into unity using their own script. I had plans to try to recreate an area in sydney but this was easier and less time consuming</p>

        For the Sleeping pod I kitbashed together some assets I found on Sketchfab and applied some emmision based light strips to the roof to give the blue glow

            The office space once I had imported the models and materials across to unity. I played around with real time lighting and emission based lighting for a more realistic look but found it was too much of a load for my computer. I switched the emission lights out for regular lighting and some pre baked lighting.
